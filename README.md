# Cross-lingual ABSA (XABSA)
This repo contains the data and code for our paper [Cross-lingual Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Aspect Term Code-Switching ](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.727.pdf).


## Requirements
- torch==1.3.1
- numpy==1.19.4
- transformers==3.4.0 (You can also use the static version in this repo)
- sentencepiece==0.1.91
- tokenizer==0.9.2
- sacremoses==0.0.43


##  Quick Start
- Download the pre-trained multilingual language model mBERT or XLM-R
- To quickly reproduce the results with French as the target langauge and mBERT as the backbone under the supervised setting:
```python
python main.py --tfm_type mbert --tgt_lang fr
```
- To reproduce other results, ref to the `data_utils.py` for details


## Usage
- To run experiments under different settings, change the `exp_type` setting:
  * `supervised` refers to the supervised setting
  * `acs` is the proposed method
  * `acs_kd_s/m`: single/multi teacher distillation under the cross-lingual setting
  * `macs_kd`: multilingual distillation
- `run_absa.sh` provides an example script to run basic experiment.
- `run_absa_kd.sh` provides an example script to run experiments with knowledge distilling on the unlabeled target laguage data.
